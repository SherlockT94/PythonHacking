Kali Linux is constantly evolving with new features being added to the distribution all the time. In an ongoing effort, we are attempting to document common, new, or interesting features available in Kali Linux as best as we can. This has prompted the setup of our Official Kali Linux Documentation website. We believe the fastest way to get to know Kali Linux is to follow the documentation site and explore the new features available.

On our multi-language documentation site, you will find out what makes Kali Linux different from standard Linux distributions, how to install Kali on different types of hardware including ARM devices, how to create your own custom Kali Linux ISOs, and much more.

The documentation site is in a constant state of work in progress and is translated by Kali Linux community members in their free time, on a best-effort basis. As such, translated documents may fall behind the original English translations. If in doubt of accuracy, know that the English versions are the most up-to-date. If you would like to help with translations, contact us.
